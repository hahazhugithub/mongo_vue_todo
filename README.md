# mongo_vue_todo

project introduction

vue is only for view rendering  for communication with BE we can use either jquery.ajax or axios which is also suggested by Vue https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios


for this application current support both docker and local.

For local: you should set up mongodb on your local and set port as default port 27017 for this sample.

npm install
npm start

For docker: you should have docker installed on your local.

docker-compose build
docker-compose up



Thanks
